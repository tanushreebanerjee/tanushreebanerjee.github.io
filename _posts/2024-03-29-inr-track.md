We propose to recast 3D multi-object tracking from RGB cameras as an <em>Inverse Rendering</em> (IR) problem by optimizing via a differentiable rendering pipeline over the latent space of pre-trained 3D object representations and retrieving the latents that best represent object instances in a given input image. Our method is not only an alternate take on tracking; it enables examining the generated objects, reasoning about failure situations, and resolving ambiguous cases.
