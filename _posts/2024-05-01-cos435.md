We reproduce the results of "METRA: Scalable Unsupervised RL with
Metric-Aware Abstraction" (Park et al.,2024), which proposes a novel unsupervised RL objective, called Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA) (Park et al., 2024), which learns diverse, useful behaviors, as well as a compact latent space that can be used to solve various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. We validate the claims of this paper in our reproduction study, along with additional figures to confirm their claims.
