This paper trains a model to classify skin conditions based on images of skin lesions
from the Fitzpatrick17k dataset. A confidence interval on the accuracy of the trained model
across the different skin types is analyzed using the bootstrap method in order to determine
the existence of bias in the trained model. This paper conducts a thorough analysis of whether such a trained model is biased against underrepresented skin tones in the Fitzpatrick17k dataset.
