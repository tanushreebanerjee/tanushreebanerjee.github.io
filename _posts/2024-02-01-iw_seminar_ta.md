As a UCA, I held office hours for students in the independent work seminar for juniors and seniors on AI for Engineering and Physics taught by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/">Prof. Ryan Adams</a>, helping them debug their code and advising them on their semester-long independent work projects.
