We reproduce the results of "Double-Hard Debias: Tailoring Word Embeddings for Gender Bias" (<a href=https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.484>Wang et al.,2020</a>) to reduce the gender bias present in pre-trained word embeddings. Additionally, we evaluate the proposed technique and the aforementioned baselines on Spanish GloVe embeddings to assess the extent to which these debiasing methods generalize to non-English languages.
