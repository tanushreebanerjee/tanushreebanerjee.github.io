As an instructor, I developed workshops and Colab tutorials leading up to an NLP-based capstone project for this ML summer camp for high school students from underrepresented backgrounds, focusing on the potential for harm perpetuated by large language models. I also organized guest speaker talks to expose students to diverse applications of ML in non-traditional fields.
