# Multi-View Stereo

**Module 3.3** | [← Back to Index](../index.html) | [Next: SLAM →](03-3d-slam.md.html)

---

## Overview

Multi-View Stereo (MVS): Estimate dense depth maps from multiple calibrated camera views. Produces dense 3D reconstructions.

---

## Essential Papers

### 🔥 MVSNet (2018)

**MVSNet: Depth Inference for Unstructured Multi-view Stereo** (Yao et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02505)

**Key idea**: Deep learning for MVS using cost volume construction.

**Pipeline**:
1. Feature extraction from input images
2. Build cost volume by warping features to reference view at different depth hypotheses
3. 3D CNN regularizes cost volume
4. Depth map regression and refinement

[Figure placeholder: MVSNet pipeline showing cost volume construction]

**Cost volume**: 3D volume (width × height × depth hypotheses) containing matching costs.

**Advantages**: Learned matching, handles textureless regions better than traditional methods.

---

### CasMVSNet (2020)

**CasMVSNet: Cascade Cost Volume for High-Resolution Multi-View Stereo** (Gu et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06378)

**Key innovation**: Coarse-to-fine cascade approach.

**Cascade structure**:
- Stage 1: Low-resolution cost volume (fewer depth hypotheses)
- Stage 2: Higher resolution, refined depth range
- Stage 3: Highest resolution

**Benefits**: Memory efficient, enables high-resolution reconstruction.

---

### PatchmatchNet (2021)

**PatchmatchNet: Learned Multi-View Patchmatch Stereo** (Wang et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01411)

**Key idea**: Learnable PatchMatch algorithm.

**PatchMatch**: Randomized search for matching patches, iterative propagation.

**Learned components**: Feature extraction, similarity computation, propagation.

**Benefits**: Fast, memory efficient, good quality.

---

## Core Concepts

### Cost Volume

**Definition**: 3D volume encoding matching costs for each pixel at different depth hypotheses.

**Construction**: Warp features from source views to reference view at each depth.

**Regularization**: 3D CNN smooths cost volume.

**Depth selection**: Argmax or weighted average over depth dimension.

---

### Depth Map Fusion

**Problem**: Multiple views produce multiple depth maps.

**Solution**: Fuse depth maps from different reference views.

**Methods**: 
- Consistency checking
- Visibility voting
- Weighted averaging

**Output**: Dense point cloud or mesh.

---

## Comparison with Traditional MVS

**Traditional**: Hand-crafted features, patch matching, optimization.

**Learning-based**: Learned features, cost volume, CNN regularization.

**Benefits**: Better in textureless regions, more robust.

---

## Problems Solved by Multi-View Stereo

### Dense 3D Reconstruction
**Problem**: SfM produces sparse point cloud. Many scene regions not reconstructed. Need dense geometry.

**MVS solution**: Dense depth maps from multiple views. Produces dense point clouds or meshes covering entire scene.

[Figure placeholder: Comparison showing SfM sparse point cloud vs MVS dense reconstruction]

### Better Than Single-View Depth
**Problem**: Single-view depth estimation is ambiguous and unreliable. Multiple views needed.

**MVS solution**: Leverages multiple views to resolve depth ambiguity. Geometric constraints from multiple viewpoints enable reliable depth estimation.

---

## Remaining Challenges and Limitations

### Textureless Regions
**Problem**: Regions with little texture produce unreliable matches. Depth estimation fails.

**Open question**: Better handling of textureless regions? Alternative features or methods?

### Occlusions
**Problem**: Some parts of scene occluded in some views. Cannot reconstruct occluded regions.

**Remaining**: Fundamental limitation - need views where region is visible.

### Large Baselines
**Problem**: Very large camera baselines make matching difficult. Appearance changes too much.

**Open question**: Better matching across large baselines?

### Computational Cost
**Problem**: High-resolution MVS can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive.

**Current solutions**: Efficient implementations, multi-scale approaches, but still resource-intensive.

**Open question**: More efficient methods for large-scale MVS?

## Broader Insights and Implications

### The Sparse-to-Dense Pipeline
**Insight**: MVS demonstrates value of sparse-to-dense pipeline. SfM provides structure (poses), MVS adds density.

**Broader impact**: Shows value of multi-stage approaches. Each stage optimized for different goals. Influences design of other reconstruction methods.

### Learning Improves Matching
**Insight**: Learned MVS (MVSNet, etc.) outperforms traditional methods, especially in challenging regions.

**Broader impact**: Demonstrates value of learning for geometric tasks. Classical geometry + learning often best.
