# Classical Computer Vision

**Module 0.1** | [← Back to Index](../index.html) | [Next: Core ML →](00-foundations-core-ml.md.html)

## Overview

Classical computer vision: image processing, feature detection, matching, and geometric vision.

---

## Resources

### Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (Szeliski)
[szeliski.org](http://szeliski.org/Book/)

**Key topics:** Image processing, feature detection (SIFT, SURF), image matching, stereo vision, structure from motion.

---

### Multiple View Geometry (Hartley & Zisserman)
Classic textbook on geometric computer vision.

**Key topics:**
- Camera models (pinhole, projection matrices)
- Epipolar geometry
- Fundamental matrix
- Triangulation
- Bundle adjustment

Essential for understanding 3D reconstruction from multiple views.

## Core Concepts

### Image Features

**Corners/Keypoints**: Distinctive points in images (e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB).

**Descriptors**: Vectors describing local image patches around keypoints.

**Applications**: Feature matching, object recognition, image stitching.

---

### Feature Matching

**Goal**: Find corresponding points across multiple images.

**Methods**:
- Brute force matching with distance metrics (L2, Hamming)
- Ratio test (Lowe) to filter ambiguous matches
- RANSAC for robust matching in presence of outliers

---

### Epipolar Geometry

**Epipolar constraint**: Corresponding points in two views lie on epipolar lines.

**Fundamental matrix** $F$: Relates corresponding points: $x'^T F x = 0$

**Essential matrix** $E$: Fundamental matrix with known camera intrinsics: $E = K'^T F K$

**Applications**: Stereo vision, structure from motion, visual SLAM.

---

### Camera Models

**Pinhole camera model**: Projects 3D points to 2D image plane.

**Projection**: $x = K[R|t]X$ where:
- $K$: Camera intrinsic matrix (focal length, principal point)
- $[R|t]$: Camera extrinsic (rotation, translation)
- $X$: 3D point in world coordinates
- $x$: 2D point in image

**Distortion models**: Radial and tangential distortion correction.

---

### Camera Calibration

**Goal**: Estimate camera intrinsic parameters ($K$) and distortion coefficients.

**Zhang's method**: Use checkerboard pattern, estimate parameters from multiple views.

**Applications**: 3D reconstruction, augmented reality, robotics.

---

### Stereo Vision

**Epipolar rectification**: Align images so epipolar lines are horizontal.

**Disparity**: Horizontal offset of corresponding points.

**Depth**: $Z = \frac{fB}{d}$ where $f$ is focal length, $B$ is baseline, $d$ is disparity.

## Why Classical Computer Vision Matters

### Foundation for Modern Methods
**Insight**: Classical computer vision provides mathematical and algorithmic foundations. Many modern deep learning methods build on classical concepts (e.g., learned features replace hand-crafted SIFT).

**Broader impact**: Understanding classical methods helps understand why modern methods work. Classical concepts still relevant and valuable.

### Geometry-Based Understanding
**Insight**: Classical methods demonstrate that geometry provides powerful constraints and understanding. Not everything needs to be learned - geometry gives us structure.

**Broader impact**: Shows value of combining geometric reasoning with learning. Geometry + learning often best approach.

### Robustness and Interpretability
**Insight**: Classical methods often more interpretable and have theoretical guarantees. Deep learning adds flexibility but can be less interpretable.

**Broader impact**: Trade-off between interpretability (classical) and flexibility (learning). Different applications need different approaches.

---

## Remaining Challenges in Classical Approaches

### Hand-Crafted Features
**Problem**: Hand-crafted features (SIFT, ORB) may not be optimal. Limited by human design.

**Solution**: Learned features often better, but classical features still useful for some applications (resource-constrained, interpretability).

### Textureless Regions
**Problem**: Feature-based methods struggle in textureless regions.

**Open question**: Better features? Alternative approaches?

### Robustness to Viewpoint Changes
**Problem**: Hand-crafted features may not generalize well across large viewpoint changes.

**Current solutions**: Robust matching (RANSAC), but limitations remain.

---

## Broader Insights and Implications

### The Classical-to-Learning Transition
**Insight**: Field has transitioned from classical (hand-crafted) to learning-based, but classical methods still valuable for understanding and as building blocks.

**Broader impact**: Demonstrates evolution of field. Classical methods not obsolete - they provide foundation and understanding.

### When to Use Classical vs Learning
**Insight**: Classical methods still useful for: resource-constrained applications, interpretability, theoretical guarantees, or as preprocessing for learning methods.

**Broader impact**: Shows that method choice depends on requirements. Not everything needs deep learning.
