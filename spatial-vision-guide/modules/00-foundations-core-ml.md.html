## Key Concepts

### Optimization Methods

**SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: Standard gradient-based optimization.

**Adam/AdamW**: Adaptive learning rate optimization, widely used in practice.

**Learning rate schedules**: Step decay, cosine annealing, warmup.

**Gradient clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients in RNNs/transformers.

Used in: NeRF training, score distillation, differentiable rendering.

---

### Backpropagation

**Forward pass**: Compute predictions through network.

**Backward pass**: Compute gradients via chain rule.

**Computational graphs**: Track gradient flow through operations.

---

### Convolutional Neural Networks

**Convolution**: Local feature extraction via sliding filters.

**Pooling**: Spatial downsampling (max, average).

**Architectures**: ResNet, EfficientNet, Vision Transformers.

CNNs are backbones for 3D vision models (feature extractors, encoders).

---

## Why These Foundations Matter for 3D Vision

### Optimization Enables Learning
**Insight**: Gradient-based optimization (SGD, Adam) is foundation of all neural learning. Without it, cannot train neural networks for 3D tasks.

**Broader impact**: Optimization methods directly affect training quality and convergence. Important to understand for effective training.

### Differentiable Operations Enable 3D Learning
**Insight**: Differentiable rendering, differentiable operations enable learning 3D from 2D supervision. Backpropagation through rendering enables NeRF, Gaussian Splatting, etc.

**Broader impact**: Differentiability is key enabling factor for modern 3D vision. Makes previously impossible learning tasks possible.

### Feature Extraction for 3D Understanding
**Insight**: CNNs provide powerful feature extractors used throughout 3D vision (feature matching, BEV detection, multi-view fusion). Foundation for representation learning.

**Broader impact**: CNN architectures influence design of 3D vision systems. Better features → better 3D understanding.

---

## Remaining Challenges in ML Foundations

### Optimization Challenges
**Problem**: Non-convex optimization, local minima, hyperparameter tuning remain challenging.

**Open question**: Better optimization methods? Automatic hyperparameter tuning?

### Computational Resources
**Problem**: Training large models requires significant computational resources.

**Current solutions**: Distributed training, efficient architectures, but still resource-intensive.

### Generalization
**Problem**: Models may not generalize well to new domains or data distributions.

**Open question**: Better generalization? Domain adaptation methods?

## Broader Insights and Implications

### The Role of Mathematics
**Insight**: Strong mathematical foundations (linear algebra, calculus, optimization) essential for understanding and improving deep learning methods.

**Broader impact**: Mathematics provides tools to understand, analyze, and improve methods. Not just implementation - need mathematical understanding.

### Theory vs Practice
**Insight**: While theory provides guidance, practice often requires empirical tuning and experimentation. Both theory and practice important.

**Broader impact**: Demonstrates value of both theoretical understanding and practical experience. Best researchers combine both.
