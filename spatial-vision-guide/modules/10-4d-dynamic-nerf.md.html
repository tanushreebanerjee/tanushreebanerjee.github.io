# Dynamic NeRFs

**Module 10.1** | [← Back to Index](../index.html) | [Next: Video-to-3D/4D →](10-4d-video-to-3d.md.html)

---

## Overview

Dynamic NeRFs: Extend NeRF to handle dynamic scenes. Model 4D scenes (3D + time) to render novel views at novel times.

---

## Essential Papers

### D-NeRF (2021)

**D-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scenes** (Pumarola et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13961)

**Key idea**: Deform canonical NeRF to each time step.

**Architecture**: 
- Canonical NeRF (static scene)
- Deformation network (time → deformation field)
- Render at any time

**Benefits**: Handles dynamic scenes, novel view synthesis.

---

### Nerfies (2021)

**Nerfies: Deformable Neural Radiance Fields** (Park et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12948)

**Key innovation**: Deformable NeRF for non-rigid scenes.

**Applications**: Selfies, portraits, deformable objects.

---

### HyperNeRF (2021)

**HyperNeRF: A Higher-Dimensional Representation for Topologically Varying Neural Radiance Fields** (Park et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13228)

**Key innovation**: Higher-dimensional representation for topology changes.

**Benefits**: Handles occlusions, topology changes better.

---

### NeRFPlayer (2022)

**NeRFPlayer: A Streamable Dynamic Scene Representation with Decomposed Neural Radiance Fields**

**Key innovation**: Efficient streaming of dynamic NeRF.

**Benefits**: Real-time dynamic NeRF rendering.

---

## Core Concepts

### Temporal Modeling

**Challenge**: Scene changes over time.

**Solutions**:
- **Deformation**: Deform canonical space to each time
- **Per-frame NeRFs**: Separate NeRF per frame (memory intensive)
- **Temporal basis**: Compact temporal representation

---

### Deformation Fields

**Process**:
1. Learn canonical NeRF (time-invariant)
2. Learn deformation network (time → deformation)
3. Query: Deform point → query canonical NeRF

**Benefits**: Compact, handles non-rigid motion.

---

### Motion Decomposition

**Rigid motion**: Camera/object movement.

**Non-rigid motion**: Deformation, articulation.

**Separation**: Model separately for better results.

---

## Problems Solved by Dynamic NeRFs

### Dynamic Scene Reconstruction
**Problem**: Original NeRF only handles static scenes. Real-world scenes have moving objects, people, dynamic lighting, changing geometry. Need to model both spatial (3D) and temporal (time) dimensions.

**Dynamic NeRF solution**: Extends NeRF to 4D (3D + time). Represents dynamic scenes as continuous function over space and time. Can render novel views at novel times.

[Figure placeholder: Visualization showing static NeRF (single scene) vs dynamic NeRF (scene evolving over time with moving objects)]

### Novel View Synthesis of Videos
**Problem**: Traditional video rendering fixed to recorded camera views. Can't generate views from arbitrary positions or interpolate between frames.

**Solution**: Dynamic NeRF enables novel view synthesis at any time. Can render from any camera position at any time point. Enables free-viewpoint video.

### Handling Non-Rigid Deformation
**Problem**: Moving objects undergo non-rigid deformation (people moving, clothes deforming, liquids flowing). Traditional methods struggle with this.

**Solution**: Deformation fields model non-rigid motion. Transform points from canonical space to deformed space at each time. Enables modeling complex motion.

---

## Remaining Challenges and Limitations

### Computational Cost
**Problem**: Dynamic NeRF requires modeling 4D space, significantly more complex than 3D. Training and rendering more expensive.

**Current solutions**: Efficient representations, factorization methods, but still slower than static NeRF.

**Open question**: More efficient 4D representations? Can we match static NeRF efficiency?

### Large-Scale Dynamic Scenes
**Problem**: Modeling entire dynamic scenes with many moving objects is challenging. Memory and computation scale poorly.

**Open question**: Better scalability? Hierarchical or compositional approaches?

### Long Video Sequences
**Problem**: Modeling long sequences (minutes to hours) requires modeling many time steps. Memory and training time grow significantly.

**Open question**: More compact temporal representations? Better compression?

### Complex Motion Patterns
**Problem**: Some motion patterns (fast motion, occlusions, complex interactions) remain challenging to model accurately.

**Open question**: Better motion modeling? More expressive deformation fields?

### Real-Time Dynamic Rendering
**Problem**: Dynamic NeRF rendering still slower than static NeRF. Real-time rendering of dynamic scenes challenging.

**Current solutions**: Acceleration methods, but real-time dynamic rendering still difficult.

**Open question**: Can we achieve real-time dynamic NeRF rendering?

### Handling Occlusions
**Problem**: Temporal occlusions (objects moving in front of each other) can cause artifacts. Need to model what's visible when.

**Open question**: Better occlusion modeling in dynamic scenes?

## Broader Insights and Implications

### Extending Implicit Representations to 4D
**Insight**: Dynamic NeRF demonstrates that implicit representation paradigm extends naturally to higher dimensions (4D = 3D + time). Same principles apply.

**Broader impact**: Shows that implicit representations are general framework, not limited to 3D. May extend to other dimensions (5D = 3D + time + lighting?).

### The Power of Canonical Space
**Insight**: Many dynamic NeRFs use canonical space + deformation field approach. Deform canonical NeRF to each time step rather than learning separate NeRF per frame.

**Broader impact**: Demonstrates value of canonical representations. Enables better generalization and more compact models. Influences design of other dynamic methods.

### Temporal vs Spatial Priors
**Insight**: Dynamic scenes benefit from both spatial priors (geometry, appearance) and temporal priors (motion smoothness, temporal consistency).

**Broader impact**: Shows importance of temporal modeling. Encourages exploration of temporal priors in other dynamic methods.

### The Continuity of Motion
**Insight**: Dynamic NeRF models motion as continuous function over time, not discrete frames. This enables interpolation, slow motion, novel time synthesis.

**Broader impact**: Demonstrates value of continuous representations for motion. Influences design of other video and dynamic methods.

### Applications Beyond View Synthesis
**Insight**: Dynamic NeRF's ability to separate geometry, motion, and appearance enables applications beyond view synthesis (motion analysis, scene understanding, editing).

**Broader impact**: Shows that good representations enable many applications. Encourages exploration of novel applications of dynamic neural rendering.
