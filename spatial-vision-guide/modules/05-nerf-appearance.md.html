# NeRF Appearance & Relighting

**Module 5.3** | [← Back to Index](../index.html) | [Previous: NeRF Acceleration ←](05-nerf-acceleration.md.html)

---

## Overview

NeRF appearance modeling: Decompose view-dependent appearance into shape, reflectance, and lighting. Enables relighting and material editing.

---

## Essential Papers

### NeRFactor (2021)

**NeRFactor: Neural Factorization of Shape and Reflectance under an Unknown Illumination** (Bi et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04970)

**Key idea**: Factorize NeRF into geometry, BRDF (material), and lighting.

**Pipeline**:
1. Train NeRF to learn geometry and appearance
2. Extract surface geometry (marching cubes)
3. Optimize BRDF properties (albedo, roughness, normal)
4. Estimate lighting environment

**Output**: Relightable scene with material properties.

### Ref-NeRF (2022)

**Ref-NeRF: Structured View-Dependent Appearance for Neural Radiance Fields** (Verbin et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03907)

**Key innovation**: Explicitly model view-dependent appearance using learned normal and reflection direction.

**Appearance model**: Separates diffuse and specular components.

**Benefits**: Better view-dependent modeling, enables relighting.

---

### Neural Reflectance Fields

**Goal**: Decompose appearance into material properties.

**Components**: Albedo, roughness, metallic, normal maps.

**Applications**: Material editing, relighting, realistic rendering.

---

## Core Concepts

### Appearance Factorization

**Geometry**: 3D shape (surface, volume).

**Material**: BRDF properties (albedo, roughness, metallic).

**Lighting**: Environment maps, light sources.

**Combined**: Render realistic appearance under different lighting.

---

### View-Dependent Appearance

**Challenge**: NeRF learns view-dependent color but doesn't separate causes.

**Solution**: Explicitly model reflection direction, normal, lighting.

**Benefits**: Better understanding, enables editing.

---

## Problems Solved by Appearance Modeling

### Enabling Relighting
**Problem**: Standard NeRF learns appearance under training lighting. Cannot change lighting or relight scene.

**Appearance factorization solution**: Decompose appearance into geometry, materials, and lighting. Enables relighting by changing lighting component.

### Material Editing
**Problem**: Standard NeRF appearance cannot be edited. Cannot change material properties (make object more shiny, change color, etc.).

**Solution**: Explicit material properties (BRDF) enable editing. Change material properties, re-render with new appearance.

### Understanding View-Dependent Effects
**Problem**: NeRF learns view-dependent appearance but doesn't separate causes (geometry, materials, lighting).

**Ref-NeRF solution**: Explicitly models reflection direction, normals, lighting. Better understanding of view-dependent appearance.

---

## Remaining Challenges and Limitations

### Ambiguity in Factorization
**Problem**: Factorization is ambiguous - same appearance can result from different combinations of geometry, materials, lighting.

**Open question**: Better constraints to resolve ambiguity? Additional supervision?

### Quality of Material Estimation
**Problem**: Estimated material properties may not be physically accurate or realistic.

**Remaining**: Challenging to estimate accurate BRDF parameters from limited views.

### Complex Lighting
**Problem**: Very complex lighting (many lights, area lights, environment maps) can be difficult to model accurately.

**Open question**: Better lighting representation? More expressive lighting models?

### Generalization
**Problem**: Material estimation may not generalize well across different scene types or lighting conditions.

**Open question**: Better generalization? More robust material estimation?

## Broader Insights and Implications

### The Ambiguity Problem in Inverse Rendering
**Insight**: Appearance factorization highlights fundamental ambiguity - same appearance can result from different factor combinations.

**Broader impact**: Demonstrates importance of priors and constraints in inverse problems. Need additional information to resolve ambiguity. Influences design of inverse rendering methods.

### Physically-Based vs Learned
**Insight**: Physically-based material models (BRDF) provide interpretability and editing capabilities, but learned representations may be more flexible.

**Broader impact**: Trade-off between interpretability (physics) and flexibility (learning). Different applications need different approaches.

### Enabling New Applications
**Insight**: Appearance modeling enables new applications (relighting, material editing, product visualization) not possible with standard NeRF.

**Broader impact**: Shows that decomposition enables new capabilities. Influences design of neural rendering methods.
