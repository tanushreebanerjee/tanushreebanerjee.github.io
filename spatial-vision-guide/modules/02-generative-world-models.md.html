# World Models

**Module 2.4** | [← Back to Index](../index.md.html) | [Previous: Video Generation ←](02-generative-video.md.html)

---

## Overview

World models: Learn predictive models of environments for planning and decision-making. Model dynamics, rewards, and state transitions from observations.

---

## Essential Papers

### 📖 World Models (2018)

**World Models** (Ha & Schmidhuber) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122)

**Key idea**: Learn compressed representation of environment, use for planning.

**Components**:
- **V**: Variational autoencoder encodes observations
- **M**: Recurrent model predicts next states
- **C**: Controller uses model for decision-making

**Benefits**: Sample-efficient RL, planning in learned model.

### Dreamer / DreamerV2 (2020-2021)

**Dreamer: Learning Models for Reinforcement Learning**

**Key innovation**: Actor-critic learning from world model predictions.

**Benefits**: Strong performance, sample efficient.

---

### World Models with NeRF / Diffusion

**Recent approaches**: Use NeRF or diffusion models as world models.

**Benefits**: High-fidelity predictions, better visual quality.

---

## Core Concepts

### Model-Based RL

**Goal**: Learn environment dynamics model, use for planning.

**Advantages**: Sample efficient, enables planning.

**Challenges**: Model errors compound, requires good models.

---

### World Model Components

**Observation encoder**: Compress observations to latent states.

**Dynamics model**: Predict next states from actions.

**Reward model**: Predict rewards (if needed).

**Decoder**: Reconstruct observations from states (optional).

---

### Planning

**Methods**: 
- Model-predictive control (MPC)
- Value iteration
- Policy search in model

---

## Problems Solved by World Models

### Sample-Efficient RL
**Problem**: Reinforcement learning can be sample-inefficient - requires many interactions with environment.

**World model solution**: Learn environment model, plan in model. Much more sample-efficient than model-free RL.

[Figure placeholder: Comparison showing model-free RL (many samples) vs world model RL (fewer samples)]

### Planning Without Real Environment
**Problem**: Need to plan actions but don't want to try all in real environment (expensive, dangerous).

**Solution**: Learn world model, plan in simulated model. Safe, fast planning.

---

## Remaining Challenges and Limitations

### Model Accuracy
**Problem**: World models may not perfectly capture environment. Model errors compound, can cause planning failures.

**Open question**: Better world models? More accurate predictions?

### Generalization
**Problem**: World models may not generalize well to new environments or situations.

**Open question**: Better generalization? Transfer learning?

---

## Broader Insights and Implications

### The Value of Predictive Models
**Insight**: World models demonstrate value of learning predictive models. Enables planning, reasoning.

**Broader impact**: Shows importance of model-based approaches. Influences design of other predictive systems.
