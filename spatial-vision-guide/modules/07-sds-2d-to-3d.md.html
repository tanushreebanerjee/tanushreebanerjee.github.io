# 2D→3D Lifting

**Module 7.2** | [← Back to Index](../index.md.html) | [Next: Implicit 3D Generation →](07-sds-implicit-3d.md.html)

---

## Overview

2D→3D lifting: Reconstruct 3D objects or scenes from single or few images. Uses diffusion models or multi-view synthesis to predict 3D structure.

---

## Essential Papers

### 🔥 Zero-1-to-3 (2023)

**Zero-1-to-3: Zero-shot One Image to 3D Object** (Liu et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11328)

**Key idea**: Conditional diffusion model that generates novel views from single image.

**Architecture**: ControlNet-like conditioning on input image and camera pose.

**Process**:
1. Input: Single image + target camera pose
2. Generate novel view via diffusion
3. Generate multiple views (e.g., 16 views around object)
4. Reconstruct 3D using NeRF or MVS

**Training**: Large dataset of (image, pose, novel view) triplets.

**Benefits**: Zero-shot, works for any object, reasonable quality.

---

### 🔥 Zero-1-to-3++ (2024)

**Zero-1-to-3++: Image to 3D Object Generation via Angle-Quantized Gaussian Splatting**

**Improvements**: Uses Gaussian Splatting instead of NeRF, better quality and speed.

---

### 🔥 Wonder3D (2023)

**Wonder3D: Single Image to 3D using Cross-Domain Diffusion** (Long et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15008)

**Key innovation**: Multi-view consistent generation in single pass.

**Cross-domain attention**: Ensures consistency across views.

**Benefits**: Better multi-view consistency, higher quality.

---

### 🔥 SyncDreamer (2023)

**SyncDreamer: Generating Multiview-consistent Images from a Single-view Image** (Liu et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03453)

**Key idea**: Generate all views simultaneously with consistency constraints.

**Benefits**: Better multi-view consistency than sequential generation.

---

### LGM (2024)

**LGM: Large Multi-View Gaussian Model for High-Resolution 3D Reconstruction**

**Key idea**: Large-scale model trained on many 3D objects for direct 3D prediction.

---

## Core Concepts

### Single-Image 3D Reconstruction

**Challenge**: Ambiguous depth from single view.

**Solutions**:
- **Multi-view synthesis**: Generate novel views, then reconstruct
- **Direct prediction**: Predict 3D structure directly
- **Geometry priors**: Use learned 3D priors

---

### Multi-View Consistency

**Problem**: Generated views may be inconsistent.

**Solutions**:
- **Cross-view attention**: Ensure consistency during generation
- **3D constraints**: Enforce 3D geometric consistency
- **Iterative refinement**: Refine views to be consistent

---

### Reconstruction Pipeline

**Step 1**: Generate multiple views from input image.

**Step 2**: Estimate camera poses (if unknown).

**Step 3**: Reconstruct 3D using:
- NeRF optimization
- Multi-view stereo
- Gaussian Splatting
- Direct 3D prediction
