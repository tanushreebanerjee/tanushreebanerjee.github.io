# Video-to-3D/4D

**Module 10.2** | [← Back to Index](../index.html) | [Previous: Dynamic NeRFs ←](10-4d-dynamic-nerf.md.html)

---

## Overview

Video-to-3D/4D: Convert monocular videos into 3D or 4D (dynamic 3D) representations. Enables free-viewpoint video and dynamic scene reconstruction.

---

## Essential Papers

### Neural Scene Flow Fields (NSFF) (2021)

**Neural Scene Flow Fields for Space-Time View Synthesis of Dynamic Scenes** (Li et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13084)

**Key idea**: Joint reconstruction of geometry, appearance, and scene flow.

**Representation**: Neural fields for static scene + scene flow.

**Benefits**: Novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes.

---

### Video-to-3D Methods

**Approaches**:
- **Multi-view stereo**: Treat video as multi-view input
- **Neural rendering**: Use NeRF/Gaussian Splatting
- **Hybrid**: Combine geometry + neural rendering

---

### Recent Methods (2024-2025)

**Key innovations**:
- Better temporal consistency
- Faster reconstruction
- Higher quality

---

## Core Concepts

### Video as Multi-View

**Insight**: Video frames can be treated as multi-view images.

**Challenges**: 
- Moving cameras
- Dynamic scenes
- Temporal consistency

**Solutions**: 
- Estimate camera poses
- Handle scene motion
- Ensure consistency

---

### Temporal Consistency

**Goal**: Reconstructed 3D/4D should be consistent across frames.

**Methods**:
- Temporal regularization
- Scene flow
- Deformation fields

---

### Reconstruction Pipeline

**Step 1**: Estimate camera poses (SfM or learning-based).

**Step 2**: Reconstruct geometry (MVS, neural rendering).

**Step 3**: Model dynamics (scene flow, deformation).

**Step 4**: Refine for consistency.

## Problems Solved by Video-to-3D/4D

### 3D/4D from Monocular Video
**Problem**: Single camera video is easier to capture than multi-view setups. Can we extract 3D/4D from monocular video?

**Video-to-3D solution**: Treat video as multi-view sequence. Estimate camera motion, reconstruct 3D/4D from video frames.

### Free-Viewpoint Video
**Problem**: Recorded video fixed to camera viewpoint. Can't change viewpoint.

**Solution**: Reconstruct 3D/4D representation enables rendering from arbitrary viewpoints. Free-viewpoint video from single camera.

---

## Remaining Challenges and Limitations

### Camera Motion Estimation
**Problem**: Accurate camera pose estimation from video can be challenging, especially with moving objects.

**Open question**: Better camera tracking in dynamic scenes?

### Temporal Consistency
**Problem**: Ensuring 3D/4D reconstruction is consistent across all frames is challenging.

**Open question**: Better temporal consistency? Guaranteed consistency?

### Complex Dynamics
**Problem**: Very complex dynamic scenes (many moving objects, interactions) remain challenging.

**Open question**: Better handling of complex dynamics?

## Broader Insights and Implications

### Video as Multi-View Source
**Insight**: Video frames can be treated as multi-view images. Enables using multi-view techniques on video.

**Broader impact**: Demonstrates value of treating video as spatial sequence. Opens video to multi-view methods.
