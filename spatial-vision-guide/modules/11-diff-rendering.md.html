## Problems Solved by Differentiable Rendering

### Enabling Learning from 2D Supervision
**Problem**: Want to learn 3D parameters (shape, pose) from 2D images. Rendering is non-differentiable, blocking backpropagation.

**Differentiable rendering solution**: Make rendering differentiable. Enables gradient-based optimization from 2D loss to 3D parameters.

### End-to-End Learning
**Problem**: Traditional pipelines have discrete steps (detection, reconstruction, optimization). Cannot optimize end-to-end.

**Solution**: Differentiable rendering enables end-to-end learning. Optimize entire pipeline jointly.

### No Intermediate Representations Needed
**Problem**: Learning 3D often requires intermediate explicit representations (meshes, point clouds) which can have artifacts.

**Solution**: Can learn directly from differentiable rendering without intermediate representations. Optimize parameters that render well.

---

## Remaining Challenges and Limitations

### Gradient Quality
**Problem**: Approximate gradients from differentiable rendering may not be as accurate as true gradients. Can affect optimization.

**Open question**: Better gradient approximations? More accurate differentiable rendering?

### Memory and Computation
**Problem**: Differentiable rendering can be memory-intensive and computationally expensive, especially for high-resolution rendering.

**Current solutions**: Efficient implementations, approximations, but trade-offs remain.

**Open question**: More efficient differentiable rendering?

### Discretization Effects
**Problem**: Rendering involves discretization (pixels, samples). Can cause gradient issues or artifacts.

**Remaining**: Need careful handling of discretization for good gradients.

### Non-Differentiable Operations
**Problem**: Some rendering operations (e.g., texture lookups, some shading models) may not be fully differentiable.

**Open question**: Fully differentiable rendering pipelines?
