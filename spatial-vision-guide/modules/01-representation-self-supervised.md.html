# Self-Supervised Learning

**Module 1.1** | [← Back to Index](../index.md.html) | [Next: Multimodal Foundation Models →](01-representation-multimodal.md.html)

---

## Overview

Self-supervised learning: Learn visual representations without human labels. Contrastive learning, masked image modeling, and other pretext tasks enable learning from unlabeled data.

---

## Essential Papers

### 🔥 SimCLR (2020)

**A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning** (Chen et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709)

**Key idea**: Contrastive learning with data augmentation.

**Framework**:
1. Apply random augmentations to image (two views)
2. Encode both views with CNN
3. Maximize similarity of augmented pairs
4. Minimize similarity with other images

**Loss**: InfoNCE loss:
$$L = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_j) / \tau)}{\sum_{k \neq i} \exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_k) / \tau)}$$

**Components**:
- Strong data augmentation crucial
- Large batch sizes help
- Non-linear projection head improves representations

### 🔥 MoCo (2020)

**Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning** (He et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722)

**Key innovation**: Momentum encoder + memory bank for large negatives.

**Momentum encoder**: Moving average of main encoder, more stable.

**Memory bank**: Stores features from past batches, enables many negatives without large batches.

**Benefits**: Works with smaller batches, better representations.

---

### 🔥 BYOL (2020)

**Bootstrap Your Own Latent** (Grill et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733)

**Key innovation**: Self-supervised learning without negatives.

**Architecture**: Two networks (online and target), online predicts target.

**Process**: Online network predicts augmented view, target provides targets (moving average).

**Benefits**: No negative sampling needed, simpler.

**Surprising**: Works without collapse (still not fully understood).

---

### 🔥 DINO (2021)

**Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers** (Caron et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14294)

**Key idea**: Self-distillation with vision transformers.

**Process**: Teacher and student ViTs, teacher provides soft targets.

**Benefits**: Learns segmentation-like attention, strong features.

**Use case**: Foundation features for many vision tasks.

---

### 🔥 DINOv2 (2024)

**DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision** (Oquab et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193)

**Improvements over DINO**:
- Larger dataset (142M images)
- Better training recipe
- Stronger features

**Benefits**: Strong general-purpose features, good for downstream tasks.

---

### MAE (2021)

**Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners** (He et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377)

**Key idea**: Mask random image patches, predict masked patches.

**Process**:
1. Mask ~75% of image patches
2. Encode visible patches with ViT
3. Decode to reconstruct masked patches

**Benefits**: Simple, scalable, strong features.

---

## Core Concepts

### Contrastive Learning

**Goal**: Learn representations where similar samples are close, dissimilar are far.

**Positive pairs**: Different views of same image (augmentations).

**Negative pairs**: Different images.

**Loss**: Contrastive loss pushes positives together, negatives apart.

---

### Data Augmentation

**Critical component**: Strong augmentations essential for good representations.

**Common augmentations**: Random crop, color jitter, blur, flip.

**Augmentation policy**: Stronger augmentations → better generalization.

---

### Non-Linear Projection

**Projection head**: Small MLP on top of encoder.

**Purpose**: Separate representation learning from contrastive learning.

**Removal**: Projection head removed after training, use encoder features.

## Applications

- Pre-training for downstream tasks
- Feature extraction
- Image retrieval
- Segmentation (DINO attention)
- Foundation for other models (CLIP uses self-supervised features)
