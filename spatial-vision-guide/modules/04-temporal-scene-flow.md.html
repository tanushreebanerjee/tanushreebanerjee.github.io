# Scene Flow

**Module 4.3** | [← Back to Index](../index.md.html) | [Previous: Feature Matching ←](04-temporal-matching.md.html)

---

## Overview

Scene flow: 3D motion field describing how each 3D point moves between frames. Extension of optical flow to 3D space.

---

## Essential Papers

### NSFF (2021)

**Neural Scene Flow Fields for Space-Time View Synthesis of Dynamic Scenes** (Li et al.) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13084)

**Key idea**: Neural representation of scene flow for dynamic scene rendering.

**Representation**: Neural field maps 3D position and time to scene flow (3D motion vector).

**Benefits**: Enables novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes.

---

### RigidFlow / DynFlow

**RigidFlow**: Assumes rigid body motion, more efficient.

**DynFlow**: Handles non-rigid deformation.

---

## Core Concepts

### Scene Flow vs Optical Flow

**Optical flow**: 2D motion in image plane (where pixel moves).

**Scene flow**: 3D motion in world space (how 3D point moves).

**Relationship**: Scene flow projects to optical flow via camera projection.

---

### Estimation Methods

**Direct**: Estimate 3D motion directly from RGB/RGB-D sequences.

**Indirect**: Estimate optical flow, triangulate to 3D, compute scene flow.

**Learning-based**: Neural networks predict scene flow from RGB images.

---

## Problems Solved by Scene Flow

### 3D Motion Understanding
**Problem**: Optical flow gives 2D motion. Need to understand how objects move in 3D space.

**Scene flow solution**: Provides 3D motion field. Understand motion in world space, not just image plane.

### Enabling Dynamic 3D Reconstruction
**Problem**: Dynamic scene reconstruction requires understanding 3D motion. Optical flow insufficient.

**Solution**: Scene flow enables dynamic 3D reconstruction. Understand how 3D points move over time.

---

## Remaining Challenges and Limitations

### Estimation from RGB Only
**Problem**: Scene flow from RGB images is more ambiguous than from RGB-D. Requires strong priors or learning.

**Open question**: Better RGB-only scene flow estimation?

### Complex Motion
**Problem**: Non-rigid motion, occlusions, fast motion remain challenging.

**Open question**: Better handling of complex motion patterns?

---

## Broader Insights and Implications

### 3D Motion as Foundation
**Insight**: Scene flow provides foundation for dynamic scene understanding. Essential for 4D reconstruction.

**Broader impact**: Shows importance of 3D motion understanding. Influences design of dynamic scene methods.
